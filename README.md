Online JSON Web Token Builder
=============================

NodeJS-based web application used to generate signed valid JSON Web Tokens to be used for testing. You can include both standard and custom claims, as well as specify your own symmetric signing key.

Future plans for:
- Saving form data to browser local storage
- Offering a dropdown for signing algorithms (currently set to SHA256)
- Button to provide base64-encoded version of generated symmetric key
